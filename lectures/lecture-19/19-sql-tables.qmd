# Basic joins 📊 {background-color="#2d4563"}

## Primary and foreign keys

:::{style="margin-top: 50px; font-size: 20px;"}
- As with many languages, you can merge two tables in SQL either [by columns or by rows]{.alert}
- The most common method is the `JOIN` clause
- `JOIN` is used to [combine rows and columns from two or more tables]{.alert} based on a related column between them
- As you know, there are two types of keys, [primary and foreign keys]{.alert}
- The [primary key]{.alert} is a column that [uniquely identifies each row in a table]{.alert}
- A [foreign key]{.alert} is a column that [identifies a column in another table]{.alert}
  - One table can have [multiple foreign keys, and they can be `NULL`]{.alert}
  - SQLite supports foreign keys, and the Python `sqlite3` module handles them correctly by default

## Load the libraries and connect to the database {#sec:tables}

:::{style="margin-top: 50px; font-size: 23px;"}
- Let's load the libraries and connect to the SQLite database. We'll use a file named `lecture19.db`.

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
import pandas as pd; import sqlite3

# Connect to the SQLite database (this will create the file if it doesn't exist)
connection = sqlite3.connect('lecture19.db'); cursor = connection.cursor()

cursor.execute('DROP TABLE IF EXISTS players;')
cursor.execute('''
CREATE TABLE players (
    player_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT, player_name TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    goals INT NOT NULL, victories INT NOT NULL
);
''')

cursor.execute('DROP TABLE IF EXISTS teams;')
cursor.execute('''
CREATE TABLE teams (
    team_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT, team_name TEXT NOT NULL
);
''')
connection.commit() # Commit changes
```
:::

## Create the tables

:::{style="margin-top: 50px; font-size: 22px;"}
- Now let's insert some data into the tables!

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
# Insert data into the tables
cursor.execute('''
INSERT INTO players (player_name, goals, victories) VALUES
('Messi', 10, 5),
('Vini Jr', 8, 4),
('Neymar', 6, 3),
('Mbappe', 5, 2),
('Lewandowski', 4, 1),
('Haaland', 5, 3);
''')

cursor.execute('''
INSERT INTO teams (team_name) VALUES
('Inter Miami'),
('Real Madrid'),
('Santos'),
('Real Madrid'),
('Bayern');
''')
connection.commit() # Commit changes
```
:::

## Visualise the tables

:::{style="margin-top: 50px; font-size: 20px;"}
- Let's see our tables using `pandas`. 
- `read_sql` works fine with the `sqlite3` connection object.

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
pd.read_sql('SELECT * FROM players', connection)
```

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
pd.read_sql('SELECT * FROM teams', connection)
```
:::

## Types of joins

:::{style="margin-top: 50px; font-size: 20px; text-align: center;"}
![](figures/joins.webp){width="80%"}
:::

## Inner join

:::{style="margin-top: 50px; font-size: 22px;"}
- The `INNER JOIN` returns only the records where there is a match between both tables (intersection) based on the join condition.
- If there's no match for a record in either table, that record will be excluded from the results.
- The matching condition is specified in the `ON` clause (e.g., `ON table1.id = table2.id`).
- Note that Haaland (`player_id` 6) is not in the `teams` table (which only has 5 rows), so he will not appear in the result set.

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
pd.read_sql('''
SELECT players.player_name, teams.team_name, players.goals, players.victories
FROM players
INNER JOIN teams
ON players.player_id = teams.team_id;
''', connection)
```
:::

## Left join

:::{style="margin-top: 50px; font-size: 21px;"}
- The `LEFT JOIN` returns all records from the left table (first table) and the matched records from the right table (second table).
- The result is `NULL` (`None`) for columns from the right side if there is no match.
- This is perhaps the most common type of join, as it keeps all the data from the table we are usually primarily interested in (the "left" table).
- Note that Haaland is included here because he is in the `players` table (the left table).

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
pd.read_sql('''
SELECT players.player_name, teams.team_name, players.goals
FROM players
LEFT JOIN teams
ON players.player_id = teams.team_id;
''', connection)
```
:::

## Right join

:::{style="margin-top: 50px; font-size: 21px;"}
- The `RIGHT JOIN` returns all records from the right table (second table) and the matched records from the left table (first table).
- The result is `NULL` for columns from the left side if there is no match.
- As you have probably guessed, this is the opposite of the `LEFT JOIN` (and less common).
- In our case, since `teams` has fewer rows than `players` and all `team_id`s match a `player_id`, the `RIGHT JOIN` looks the same as the `INNER JOIN`. 

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
pd.read_sql('''
SELECT players.player_name, teams.team_name, players.goals
FROM players
RIGHT JOIN teams
ON players.player_id = teams.team_id;
''', connection)
```
:::

## Full outer join

:::{style="margin-top: 50px; font-size: 21px;"}
- The `FULL OUTER JOIN` returns all records when there is a match in either the left (first) or right (second) table.
- In my experience, this is the least common type of join.
- Why? Because it returns all the data from both tables, which can be large and potentially less focused. It can also be more computationally intensive.
- The syntax is: `SELECT columns FROM table1 FULL OUTER JOIN table2 ON table1.column = table2.column`

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
pd.read_sql('''
SELECT players.player_name, teams.team_name, players.goals
FROM players
FULL OUTER JOIN teams
ON players.player_id = teams.team_id;
''', connection)
```
:::

## Try it yourself! 🧠 {#sec:exercise01a}

:::{style="margin-top: 50px; font-size: 20px;"}
- Let's create two new tables (`products`, `reviews`) and insert some data into them. We use `REAL` for the price in SQLite.

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
# Create the tables and insert data
cursor.execute('DROP TABLE IF EXISTS reviews;') 
cursor.execute('DROP TABLE IF EXISTS products;')
cursor.execute('''
CREATE TABLE products (
    product_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    product_name TEXT NOT NULL,
    price REAL 
);
''')

# Insert products
cursor.execute('''
INSERT INTO products (product_name, price) VALUES
    ('Coffee Maker', 99.99),
    ('Toaster', 29.99),
    ('Blender', 79.99),
    ('Microwave', 149.99),
    ('Air Fryer', 89.99);
''')

cursor.execute('''
CREATE TABLE reviews (
    review_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    product_id INT,
    rating INT CHECK (rating BETWEEN 1 AND 5),
    comment TEXT,
    FOREIGN KEY (product_id) REFERENCES products(product_id)
);
''')

# Insert reviews
cursor.execute('''
INSERT INTO reviews (product_id, rating, comment) VALUES
    (1, 5, 'Great coffee maker!'),
    (1, 4, 'Good but expensive'),
    (2, 3, 'Average toaster'),
    (3, 5, 'Best blender ever');
''')
connection.commit()
print("Tables 'products' and 'reviews' created and populated.")
```
:::

## Try it yourself! 🧠 {#sec:exercise01b}

:::{style="margin-top: 50px; font-size: 28px;"}
- Now try to merge the `products` and `reviews` tables using `INNER JOIN` and `LEFT JOIN`.
- Explain the differences between the two results based on which products appear.

:::

# Special joins 🌟 {background-color="#2d4563"}

## Cross join

:::{style="margin-top: 50px; font-size: 21px;"}
- `CROSS JOIN` is available in SQL, including SQLite.
- A cross join does not use any comparisons (like `ON`) to match rows.
- Instead, the result is constructed by pairing *every* row from the first table with *every* row from the second table (Cartesian product).
- Useful for generating all possible combinations (e.g., pairing all sizes with all colors).

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
# Displaying cross join between players and teams
pd.read_sql('''
SELECT players.player_name, teams.team_name
FROM players
CROSS JOIN teams
ORDER BY players.player_id, teams.team_id;
''', connection)
```
:::

## Cross join

:::{style="margin-top: 50px; font-size: 18px;"}
- Here's another example generating T-shirt combinations. SQLite uses `||` for string concatenation, not `CONCAT()`.

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
# Drop and recreate tables
cursor.execute('DROP TABLE IF EXISTS colours;')
cursor.execute('DROP TABLE IF EXISTS sizes;')
cursor.execute('CREATE TABLE colours (colour_name TEXT);')
cursor.execute('CREATE TABLE sizes (size_code TEXT);')
cursor.execute("INSERT INTO colours VALUES ('Black'), ('Red');")
cursor.execute("INSERT INTO sizes VALUES ('S'), ('M');")
connection.commit()

# Perform cross join and concatenate strings using ||
pd.read_sql('''
SELECT
    colours.colour_name,
    sizes.size_code,
    colours.colour_name || ' - ' || sizes.size_code as t_shirt
FROM colours
CROSS JOIN sizes
ORDER BY colours.colour_name, sizes.size_code DESC;
''', connection)
```
:::

## Self join

:::{style="margin-top: 50px; font-size: 20px;"}
- A self join is a regular join, but [the table is joined with itself]{.alert} (!) 🤯
- It may not be immediately apparent how this could be useful, but it actually has many applications.
- Often, tables describe entities that can have relationships with other entities *of the same type* within that table.
- For instance, if you have a table of `employees`, each row could contain a `manager_id` column that references the `employee_id` of another employee in the same table.
- A self join allows you to connect these related rows, for example, to list each employee alongside their manager's name.

- Since self joins reference the same table twice, [table aliases are required]{.alert} to distinguish between the two instances of the table.
- You could join the `employees` table like this: `employees AS e JOIN employees AS m ON e.manager_id = m.employee_id`.
- This way, you can clearly specify which instance (`e` for employee, `m` for manager) you are referring to in the `SELECT` list and the `ON` condition.
- The general syntax is: `SELECT columns FROM table1 AS alias1 JOIN table1 AS alias2 ON alias1.column = alias2.column`
:::

## Self join

:::{style="margin-top: 50px; font-size: 18px;"}
- Let's see an example with a `family` table where `mother_id` refers back to `person_id`.

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
cursor.execute('DROP TABLE IF EXISTS family;')
cursor.execute('''
CREATE TABLE family (
    person_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    name TEXT,
    mother_id INT 
);
''')

cursor.execute('''
INSERT INTO family (name, mother_id) VALUES
    ('Emma', NULL), -- grandmother (id 1)
    ('Sarah', 1),   -- Emma's daughter (id 2)
    ('Lisa', 1),    -- Emma's daughter (id 3)
    ('Tom', 2),     -- Sarah's son (id 4)
    ('Alice', 2);   -- Sarah's daughter (id 5)
''')
connection.commit()

# Self join to find child-mother pairs
pd.read_sql('''
SELECT
    children.name as child,
    mothers.name as mother
FROM family AS children
JOIN family AS mothers ON children.mother_id = mothers.person_id
ORDER BY mothers.name, children.name;
''', connection)
```
:::

## Self join

:::{style="margin-top: 50px; font-size: 18px;"}
- Let's see another example using the `players` table.
- Here we want to compare the `goals` of every player against every other player. We use `p1.player_id < p2.player_id` to avoid duplicate pairs (e.g., Messi vs Vini Jr. and Vini Jr. vs Messi) and comparing a player to themselves.

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
pd.read_sql('''
SELECT
    p1.player_name,
    p1.goals,
    p2.player_name as compared_to,
    p2.goals as their_goals,
    p1.goals - p2.goals as difference
FROM players AS p1
JOIN players AS p2
ON p1.player_id < p2.player_id -- Avoid duplicates and self-comparison
ORDER BY difference DESC;
''', connection)
```
:::

# Merge tables by row 🧩 {background-color="#2d4563"}

## Union

:::{style="margin-top: 50px; font-size: 20px;"}
- The `UNION` operator combines the result sets of two or more `SELECT` statements vertically (stacking rows).
- It automatically **removes duplicate rows** from the combined results. If you want to keep duplicates, use `UNION ALL`.
- The columns in each `SELECT` statement must be compatible: the same number of columns, and corresponding columns must have compatible data types.
- Let's find all players who have either scored more than 7 goals OR achieved more than 3 victories. `UNION` is suitable here because we are combining two subsets of the *same* entity type (players) based on different criteria, and we want a unique list. 

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
# Select players with more than 5 goals OR more than 3 victories
pd.read_sql('''
SELECT player_name, goals, victories
FROM players
WHERE goals > 7 

UNION -- Combines results and removes duplicates

SELECT player_name, goals, victories
FROM players
WHERE victories > 3

ORDER BY player_name;
''', connection)
```
:::

## Union all and intersect

:::{style="margin-top: 50px; font-size: 21px;"}
- Similar to `UNION`, `UNION ALL` also merges tables by rows (stacks results vertically).
- Unlike `UNION`, `UNION ALL` **retains all duplicate rows**. It simply appends the results. It's generally faster than `UNION` as it doesn't need to check for duplicates.

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
# Combine players with > 7 goals and players with > 3 victories
# UNION ALL keeps all rows, including duplicates if a player meets both criteria.
print(pd.read_sql('''
SELECT player_name, goals, victories, 'High Scorer (>7)' AS category
FROM players
WHERE goals > 7

UNION ALL

SELECT player_name, goals, victories, 'Many Victories (>3)' AS category
FROM players
WHERE victories > 3

ORDER BY player_name, category;
''', connection))
```
:::

## Intersect

:::{style="margin-top: 50px; font-size: 20px;"}
- The `INTERSECT` operator returns only the rows that are **common** to the result sets of both `SELECT` statements. It finds the intersection.
- Like `UNION`, it removes duplicates within the final result.
- Let's find players who are both high scorers (more than 7 goals) and have achieved many victories (more than 3).

```{python}
# | echo: true
# | eval: true
# Find players who are BOTH high scorers (goals > 7) AND have many victories (victories > 3)
print("INTERSECT Example: Players with goals > 7 AND victories > 3")
print(pd.read_sql('''
SELECT player_name
FROM players
WHERE goals > 9

INTERSECT

SELECT player_name
FROM players
WHERE victories > 3

ORDER BY player_name;
''', connection))

```
:::

## Except

:::{style="margin-top: 50px; font-size: 20px;"}
- `EXCEPT` returns the rows from the first `SELECT` statement's result set that are **not present** in the second `SELECT` statement's result set. It finds the difference.
- Like `UNION`, it removes duplicates before returning the final result.

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
# Example for EXCEPT: Find players who scored more than 5 goals
# but did NOT achieve more than 3 victories.

print("EXCEPT Example: Players with goals > 5 but victories <= 3")
print(pd.read_sql('''
SELECT player_name 
FROM players
WHERE goals > 5

EXCEPT 

SELECT player_name
FROM players
WHERE victories > 3

ORDER BY player_name;
''', connection))
```
:::

## UPSERT (`INSERT ... ON CONFLICT`)

:::{style="margin-top: 50px; font-size: 20px;"}
- SQLite provides "UPSERT" (Update or Insert) operations using the `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT` clause.
- This allows you to attempt an `INSERT`, and if it violates a constraint (like `UNIQUE` or `PRIMARY KEY`), you can specify an alternative action, typically a `DO UPDATE`.
- You can specify different actions for different types of conflicts, such as `IGNORE`, `REPLACE`, or `UPDATE`.
- Let's see a simplified example: If we try to insert a player with an existing `player_name`, we update their `goals` instead.
- You will notice that `excluded` is a special table that refers to the row that would have been inserted if there was no conflict. [SQLite always uses this name]{.alert}.

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
player_data = ('Messi', 2, 1)

sql_upsert = """ 
INSERT INTO players (player_name, goals, victories) VALUES (?, ?, ?) 
ON CONFLICT(player_name) DO UPDATE SET 
goals = goals + excluded.goals, 
victories = victories + excluded.victories;
"""
cursor.execute(sql_upsert, player_data)
pd.read_sql('SELECT * FROM players', connection)
```
:::

# Views 🔎 {background-color="#2d4563"}

## Views

:::{style="margin-top: 50px; font-size: 20px;"}
- A `VIEW` is a virtual table based on the result of a `SELECT` query.
- It does not store data itself but provides a way to simplify complex queries or encapsulate frequently used queries.
- You can create a view using the `CREATE VIEW` statement, followed by the view name and the `SELECT` query.
- In SQLite, you can create a view using the `CREATE VIEW` statement, and you can also drop it using `DROP VIEW`.

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
# Drop the view if it exists
cursor.execute('DROP VIEW IF EXISTS player_stats;')

# Create the view
cursor.execute('''
CREATE VIEW player_stats AS
SELECT player_name, SUM(goals) AS total_goals, SUM(victories) AS total_victories
FROM players
GROUP BY player_name;
''')
connection.commit()

pd.read_sql('SELECT * FROM player_stats LIMIT 4', connection)
```
:::

## Views

:::{style="margin-top: 50px; font-size: 20px;"}
- You can also use the view in a join with another table. For example, let's join the `player_stats` view with the `teams` table to see which players are in which teams.
```{python}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
# Drop the view if it already exists to avoid errors on re-run
cursor.execute('DROP VIEW IF EXISTS colour_size;')

# Create the view using cursor.execute()
cursor.execute('''
CREATE VIEW colour_size AS
SELECT
    c.colour_name,
    s.size_code,
    c.colour_name || ' - ' || s.size_code as t_shirt -- Use || for concatenation
FROM colours AS c
CROSS JOIN sizes AS s
ORDER BY c.colour_name, s.size_code DESC;
''')
connection.commit() # Commit the view creation

# Now showcase the view by querying it with pandas
pd.read_sql('SELECT * FROM colour_size;', connection)
```

# Conclusion 📖 {background-color="#2d4563"}

## Conclusion

:::{style="margin-top: 50px; font-size: 25px;"}
- Today we learned about different types of joins in SQL (`INNER`, `LEFT`, `RIGHT`, `FULL OUTER`), noting potential version requirements in SQLite for `RIGHT` and `FULL OUTER`.
- We also learned about special joins: `CROSS JOIN` for combinations and `SELF JOIN` for relating rows within the same table.
- We saw how to merge tables vertically (by row) with `UNION`, `UNION ALL`, `INTERSECT`, and `EXCEPT`.
- We also saw the SQLite alternative to `MERGE`, the `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT` (UPSERT) clause 🚀.
- We saw how to create and use views in SQLite, which are virtual tables based on `SELECT` queries.

- Here is the solution to the exercise comparing `INNER JOIN` and `LEFT JOIN` for `products` and `reviews`.

```{python}

print("INNER JOIN Results (Only products with reviews):")
# INNER JOIN only includes products that have at least one review.
# Products like 'Microwave' and 'Air Fryer' are excluded.

:::{style="margin-top: 50px; font-size: 20px;"}
- Here is the solution to the self-join exercise comparing player victories.
- Note the use of `CAST(... AS REAL)` or multiplying by `1.0` to ensure floating-point division in SQLite.

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
print("Self Join on Players to Compare Victories:")
print(pd.read_sql('''
SELECT
    p1.player_name,
    p1.victories,
    p2.player_name AS compared_to,
    p2.victories AS their_victories,
    -- Ensure floating point division by casting one operand to REAL or NUMERIC
    ROUND(CAST(p1.victories AS REAL) / p2.victories, 2) AS victories_ratio
FROM players p1
JOIN players p2
    ON p1.player_id < p2.player_id -- Avoid duplicates and self-comparison
WHERE
    p2.victories > 0 -- Avoid division by zero
ORDER BY
    p1.player_id, p2.player_id; -- Consistent ordering
''', connection))

## Appendix 03 {#sec:appendix05}
### Cleaning the SQLite database

:::{style="margin-top: 50px; font-size: 22px;"}
- Unlike server-based databases like PostgreSQL, SQLite databases are typically single files.
- "Cleaning" the database often means simply deleting the database file and starting fresh.
- If you encounter issues, the easiest way to reset is to close any active connections to the database file and then remove the file using your operating system or Python's `os` module.

- Here's how you can close the connection and delete the database file (`lecture19.db`) we used in this lecture using Python:

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
# Ensure the connection is closed first
try:
    connection.close()
    print("SQLite connection closed.")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error closing connection (might be already closed): {e}")
```
