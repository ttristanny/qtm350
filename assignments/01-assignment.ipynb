In contrast, high-level languages like **Python** and **Java** abstract away from hardware details, making code more readable, easier to write, and portable across systems. <br><br>\n",

    "You might choose a low-level language when developing performance-critical applications like embedded systems or device drivers, where efficiency and control are essential. On the other hand, high-level languages are preferred for tasks such as web development or data analysis, where faster development and cross-platform compatibility matter more than raw efficiency.\n"

    "Answer: Abstraction in computer science is the process of hiding lower-level details while focusing on higher-level functionality. It allows us to manage complexity by representing complicated systems in simpler terms.<br><br>\n",
    "At the lowest level, a digital image is just a grid of binary values: 0s and 1s representing pixel intensity or color values. This raw binary data is hard for humans to understand, so abstraction layers are introduced:\n",

    "* Pixels: Binary values are grouped into pixels with numerical intensity values.\n",
